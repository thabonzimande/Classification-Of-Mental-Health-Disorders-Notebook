What is Mental Illness?

- A mental disorder is also characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior, often in a social context.

Driven by my own personal battles I tasked myself with creating an Advanced Classification algorithm to predict whether an individual suffers from mental illness or not. The model will then predict/diagnose which specific Mental Health condition an individual suffers from based on 17 standard symptoms used by Mental Health Proffesionals as indicators. The potential for such a tool is atronomical as I beleieve it could bridge the gap between South Africans and affordable mental healthcare, a type of healthcare that is severley.

### About the Dataset

- This dataset is a record of 120 Psychology Patients with 17 Essential Symptoms to medically Diagnose Mania Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Normal Individuals. 

- The dataset contains the 17 essential symptoms psychiatrists use to diagnose the described disorders. The behavioral symptoms are considered the levels of patients Sadness, Exhaustness, Euphoric, Sleep disorder, Mood swings, Suicidal thoughts, Anorexia, Anxiety, Try-explaining, Nervous breakdown, Ignore & Move-on, Admitting mistakes, Overthinking, Aggressive response, Optimism, Sexual activity, and Concentration in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. 

- The Normal category refer to the individuals using therapy time for specialized counseling, personal development, and life skill enrichments. While such individuals may also have minor mental problems, they differ from those suffering from Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder.
